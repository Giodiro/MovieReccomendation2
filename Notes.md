Describe _latent factor models_ (such as SVD) and _neighbourhood models_.
Incorporates implicit data (presence or absence of ratings in test set) for neighbourhood model,
introduces the simple latent factor model, and the SVD++ model.
Integrates latent factors with neighbourhood models into an Integrated model.
